      <description>Debate Content, Part II The prior post on debate content didn’t suggest much policy or issue-oriented actual debate. Nevertheless, here’s one last attempt to get at the substance of the presidential election debates.
I’m starting by estimating a mixed membership clustering algorithm, a topic model, to see if identifiable topics arise from the word usage in the debates. The structural topic model, provided in the stm package, will estimate a chosen number of topics, provide the document proportions for each topic, and the word probabilities for each topic.</description>

      <description>The Content of Debates In addition to the complexity and the tone of last Fall’s presidential election debates, I started exploring the content. What did the candidates talk about?
Content – themes, substance, issues, etc. – is a more challenging, but for my purposes, a more important, feature of this text. I started with some basic word frequencies.
rm(list=ls()) library(tidyverse) library(quanteda) library(wordcloud) setwd(&amp;quot;../../../dataForDemocracy/debate2016analysis/&amp;quot;) load(&amp;quot;debateSpeech2016.RData&amp;quot;) # the corpus as created in acquire_debates.</description>

      <description>More Debate Watch (… or debate read?) In the prior post, I introduced some analysis of the 2016 presidential debates I was playing with last fall. Here’s more!1
Let’s switch to the tone of the debate. I started by applying a common dictonary of positive and negative words (the bing dictionary available in tidytext) to capture the tone or sentiment of Trump’s and Clinton’s speech using quanteda’s dictionary function.

      <title>The Public Presidency</title>

      <description>Monitoring Presidential Information Streams The initial project of the Data for Democracy Lab @ UVA, The Public Presidency Project, began to form after a series of conversations with people from a variety of perspectives who consistently communicated: &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t read/watch the news anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s too&amp;hellip;[exhausting, depressing, distracting, anger-inducing, polarizing, &amp;hellip; ].&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s not like democratic citizens have ever been acclaimed for their political attentiveness, but at the end of the day, we need to have some idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>Exploring the Debates Campaigns debates are an interesting platform – one of the only opportunities for the candidates to appear together, in a symmetric sort of setting for the viewers (and the candidates). And one of the few moments when aspiring leaders can speak at length to a mass audience about their values, priorities, and policy intentions.
The first general election debate of 2016 broke records for presidential debate viewership, with about 84M viewers; this fell in the second debate with a still re-spectable 67M (against NFL football), and a third place record of 72M for the third debate.</description>

      <description>Community Engagement and Data Praxis Responding to increasing demand for applied trainng and experience along with a developing movement to use data and data science for the public interest, we are piloting a 1-credit Public Interest Data Lab course in Spring 2018 in partnership with UVA&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Institute. The lab course will provide experience working collaboratively, openly, and reproducibly on data science challenges brought to us by local clients.</description>

      <description>2016 Presidential Debate Analysis I don’t know about you, but during the 2016 presidential campaign, I didn’t really want to watch the presidential debates; primary, general, vice-presidential – all of them were painful in some way or another to watch.
And yet, as a political scientist who’s spent no small amount of time doing research on presidential campaigns, I felt compelled to attend to this civic event. During the primaries, I dealt with my ambivalence by following twitter debate hashtags.</description>
