      <description>Monitoring Presidential Information Streams The initial project of the Data for Democracy Lab @ UVA, The Public Presidency Project, began to form after a series of conversations with people from a variety of perspectives who consistently communicated: &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t read/watch the news anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s too&amp;hellip;[exhausting, depressing, distracting, anger-inducing, polarizing, &amp;hellip; ].&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s not like democratic citizens have ever been acclaimed for their political attentiveness, but at the end of the day, we need to have some idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>What we&amp;rsquo;re about The Data for Democracy Lab @ UVA is a place to promote the use of data science for the common good. We aspire to a data science that is educative &amp;ndash; working to ensure more people have access to the power of data, that is inclusive &amp;ndash; emphasizing the value of diverse perspectives, experiences, and knowledge, and that is open &amp;ndash; revealing the methods, models, and limits to all and allowing others to adapt, improve, or apply the work.</description>

      <description>Community Engagement and Data Praxis Responding to increasing demand for applied trainng and experience along with a developing movement to use data and data science for the public interest, we are piloting a 1-credit Public Interest Data Lab course in Spring 2018 in partnership with UVA&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Institute. The lab course will provide experience working collaboratively, openly, and reproducibly on data science challenges brought to us by local clients.</description>

      <description>2016 Presidential Debate Analysis I don’t know about you, but during the 2016 presidential campaign, I didn’t really want to watch the presidential debates; primary, general, vice-presidential – all of them were painful in some way or another to watch.
And yet, as a political scientist who’s spent no small amount of time doing research on presidential campaigns, I felt compelled to attend to this civic event. During the primaries, I dealt with my ambivalence by following twitter debate hashtags.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
