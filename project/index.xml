      <description>Monitoring Presidential Information Streams The initial project of the Data for Democracy Lab @ UVA, The Public Presidency Project, began to form after a series of conversations with people from a variety of perspectives who consistently communicated: &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t read/watch the news anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s too&amp;hellip;[exhausting, depressing, distracting, anger-inducing, polarizing, &amp;hellip; ].&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s not like democratic citizens have ever been acclaimed for their political attentiveness, but at the end of the day, we need to have some idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>Community Engagement and Data Praxis Responding to increasing demand for applied trainng and experience along with a developing movement to use data and data science for the public interest, we are piloting a 1-credit Public Interest Data Lab course in Spring 2018 in partnership with UVA&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Institute. The lab course will provide experience working collaboratively, openly, and reproducibly on data science challenges brought to us by local clients.</description>
