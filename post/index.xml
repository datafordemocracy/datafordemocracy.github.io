      <description>Exploring the Debates Campaigns debates are an interesting platform â€“ one of the only opportunities for the candidates to appear together, in a symmetric sort of setting for the viewers (and the candidates). And one of the few moments when aspiring leaders can speak at length to a mass audience about their values, priorities, and policy intentions.
The first general election debate of 2016 broke records for presidential debate viewership, with about 84M viewers; this fell in the second debate with a still re-spectable 67M (against NFL football), and a third place record of 72M for the third debate.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
