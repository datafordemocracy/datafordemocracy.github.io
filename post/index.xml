      <description>More Debate Watch (… or debate read?) In the prior post, I introduced some analysis of the 2016 presidential debates I was playing with last fall. Here’s more!1
Let’s switch to the tone of the debate. I started by applying a common dictonary of positive and negative words (the bing dictionary available in tidytext) to capture the tone or sentiment of Trump’s and Clinton’s speech using quanteda’s dictionary function.

The first general election debate of 2016 broke records for presidential debate viewership, with about 84M viewers; this fell in the second debate with a still re-spectable 67M (against NFL football), and a third place record of 72M for the third debate.</description>
