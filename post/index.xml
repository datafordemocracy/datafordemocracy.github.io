      <description>The Content of Debates In addition to the complexity and the tone of last Fall’s presidential election debates, I started exploring the content. What did the candidates talk about?
Content – themes, substance, issues, etc. – is a more challenging, but for my purposes, a more important, feature of this text. I started with some basic word frequencies.
rm(list=ls()) library(tidyverse) library(quanteda) library(wordcloud) setwd(&amp;quot;../../../dataForDemocracy/debate2016analysis/&amp;quot;) load(&amp;quot;debateSpeech2016.RData&amp;quot;) # the corpus as created in acquire_debates.</description>

      <description>More Debate Watch (… or debate read?) In the prior post, I introduced some analysis of the 2016 presidential debates I was playing with last fall. Here’s more!1
Let’s switch to the tone of the debate. I started by applying a common dictonary of positive and negative words (the bing dictionary available in tidytext) to capture the tone or sentiment of Trump’s and Clinton’s speech using quanteda’s dictionary function.

      <description>Exploring the Debates Campaigns debates are an interesting platform – one of the only opportunities for the candidates to appear together, in a symmetric sort of setting for the viewers (and the candidates). And one of the few moments when aspiring leaders can speak at length to a mass audience about their values, priorities, and policy intentions.
The first general election debate of 2016 broke records for presidential debate viewership, with about 84M viewers; this fell in the second debate with a still re-spectable 67M (against NFL football), and a third place record of 72M for the third debate.</description>
